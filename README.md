This project has a program that uses Json to save and load data files. 

How to test:
- Make a new Unity project including the script
- Play the scene and input random variables into the script via the Inspector.
- Press the S key to save the file
- Stop the play scene and replay it
- Press the L key to load the json file in the script
- Check to make sure the variables you put remain the same when loaded. 

Benefits of Json
- Easy to use
- uses multiple languages
Cons of Json
- Can be easily altered by players. Allowing them to cheat ingame items.

Functions of Json
- Used on multiple browsers
- Easy syntax usability
- Stores data in arrays for faster file loading.

Another format that might be used instead of Json might be Mongo DB. It uses both of 
Json and Server Site's benefits and functions. However, it will start charging you money if your game becomes too popular.
